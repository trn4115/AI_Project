# AI Project: Learning vs Planning in Game Playing (Connect Four)

In this project, we will evaluate and compare the performance of reinforcement learning algorithms (such as Q-learning) and planning/searching algorithms (such as Minimax and Alpha-Beta) in the game of Connect Four. The goal is to explore how these AI algorithms perform under different conditions and assess the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches in playing Connect Four.
